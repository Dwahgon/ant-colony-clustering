# Ant Colony Clustering

This is an Ant Colony Clustering algorithm, where ants (represented by @ when he's not carrying anything or & when he's carrying a body) pick up bodies (represented by *) and groups them together.

In a future version, the ants will group similar data (represented as an integer vector) using euclidian distance.

## Compiling

```sh
$ make
$ ./a.out
```
